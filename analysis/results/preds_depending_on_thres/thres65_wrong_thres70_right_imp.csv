"She peed in the hot tub! She voluntarily urinated in a hot tub while her friends were standing there, preparing to get in. And while she was being filmed for television.  It wasn't an accident. She isn't ill. She is is simply too lazy to utilize the self-discipline necessary NOT to pee whenever and wherever she wants to.  This is just the ultimate in self-absorption and self-importance.  I am aghast.","It just shows how little control she has over her body. Most people may feel the urge to urinate in hot water, but we keep ourselves from actually doing it because we are decent people and not animals. And it shows her level of maturity judging by how she joked about it and tried to laugh it off because it?s ?a thing she does??when she gets in hot tubs.  It?s so gross. I agree with another poster that her friends should stop letting her get away with crap like this.",2,2,1,0,2,2,2
