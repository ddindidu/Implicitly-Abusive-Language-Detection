Legality of taking an escort out on a movie date Would it be legal to pay an escort to go see a movie with me?  I plan on paying her standard hourly rate to go see a movie with me.,"If you offer to pay a prostitute for a date, a reasonable finder of fact may conclude that you were intending to pay for sex. So while it is not illegal to pay someone to simply go to the movies with you, you still run the risk of being convicted of prostitution.",0,0,0,0,2,2,2

"Question about a term I heard on the Netflix show White Gold (set in Essex in the 1980s) ""Rat-arsed."" I get that it means super drunk.  Is it a common phrase? Is the phrase antiquated? Is it original to the 80s? Is it still in use today? Would someone look at you funny if you said it at a pub? Can I Americanize and say ""rat-assed?"" Any other context or insight you can offer would be cool. Never heard the term before today but it sounded pretty slick.","I didn't know White Gold was on Netflix already. It was only on the telly a month or two ago. Rat-arsed is definitely still a common-enough phrase where I'm to. People would absolutely know what you mean. You're welcome to try and Americanise it if you want, but it might sound a bit weird, like when Yanks say mate, bloody hell, bugger or twat. For some reason they really can't grasp that last one.",1,1,1,1,2,2,2
"Why do people hate Snipers so much? As a sniper, I receive a lot of hate...Like I'm sorry that my shot is better than yours? I'm just curious at the communities view on it.",Every time this post comes up I say the same thing: people hate quick scoping.  There is absolutely no reason your sniper rifle should be better than an smg or shotgun up close.  If you land a great one hit kill from across the map I will tip my hat to you and continue on my way but when I'm in the trenches of Pointe Du Hoc with a shotgun and I get hit markers while you quick scope me I call bullshit.,1,1,1,1,2,2,2
Pegging advice My wife and I have been married for 15 years and have a good sex life. I recently saw a video on pegging and now I am obsessed. I want to ask her about but not sure if she will be receptive. Should I just let it go?,"The things said by others, but also a caution: i hesitate any time someone says they are obsessed. Best case: hyperbole, worst: relationship wrecker. Respect her feelings if she is hesitant. As much fun as thos fetish seems to you, she is your 15 year girl. This is something she cannot physically give you without an add on, so make sure she is into it, and knows she is still your true obsession",1,1,1,1,2,2,2

"[M/S] Checked out by my son So just had a full conversation with one of my sons topless! He definitely looked down at me a few times and I'm so wet right now it's unbelievable. I know this is small fry compared to some of the people on here, but this is the first time I've been 'checked out' by one of them - usually they don't seem arsed about my nudity!

Reddit users feel like some kind of super race OH LOOK IM USING REDDIT AND YOU? HAHAH pathetic Haha you little (insert something that isnt reddit) user you piece of shit how can you not use mighty reddit you fool.,"I completely agree. Redditors look down on insta and FB for being different. Like Reddit is so much worse because 99 percent of memes are just making fun of Instagram, fb, etc. They make cringey memes about Minecraft , as if they haven?t made fun of it for years, and make tons of Keanu Reeves memes as if they never knew about him. It pisses me off.",1,1,1,1,2,2,2
Found stray Yorkie at Grand Lawn Cemetery Hi. I was in Grand Lawn Cemetery yesterday and found a yorkie running around. It was 85 degrees when I found him and I gave him water and he cuddled right up to me. His collar had the number to a vaccination place in Wixom. The place called his owner and they hung up. I was hoping maybe someone here would maybe know a tan Yorkie named Cisco? 13 lbs. We took him to the vet and now he?s on antibiotics. He seems sad :(,If he was dumped the owners are human garbage! Infuriating. Probably trailer trash thinking no one would find their dog in a Detroit cemetery. If I were you I?d try and identify them.,1,1,1,1,2,2,2
"Give me your honest opinion, how the fuck is Bernie getting anything past congress? Republican senators are obviously all against him and let's say half the Dem ones are as well..","Signing legislation into law is only a small portion of what a president can do. For starters, I would expect Bernie to appoint an attorney general that would actually prosecute business executives for fraud. That alone would make a gigantic impact and deter future actors from acting in the kind of flagrantly reckless behavior that led to the 2008 recession. This alone is the single biggest reason that so much money is spent to prevent his election.",0,0,0,0,2,2,2
Disc Golf Seller with Cheapest International Shipping? Hi. I live in Thailand. I'd like to buy a disc or five and want a reasonable shipping rate. Infinitediscs charges $16 shipping for 1 disc.

"Another Halo anime ? I recently watched Halo Legends again, it's still so good after 7-8 years. Will 343 or Microsoft make another one ? Assuming that they have funds for it","good animation is expensive, the 343 way is too make it as cheap and quick as possible. So well probably get a crappy CGI/live action with a very basic commonly relatable story with no themes that could be remotely confusing or controversial. But I won?t complain if I?m wrong, in fact I hope 343 proves me wrong, I really want them to succeed. But man... some of the choices they make... are borderline...retarded",0,0,1,0,2,2,2
