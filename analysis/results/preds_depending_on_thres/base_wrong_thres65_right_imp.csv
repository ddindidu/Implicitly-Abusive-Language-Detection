"When is a Clothed Picture is Better than a Nude? We all love nude pics (going out on a limb here), but what clothing would your SO (or whoever) be wearing in those times you'd prefer to receive a clothed pic over a nude pic? 80s aerobic outfit? Cheerleader uni? Nun? Bikini? Panties and thigh highs? Or for the ladies: Three piece suit? Coveralls? Fireman? Banana hammock and a smile? For me, I love seeing a girl wearing panties and a sports jersey. Even if it's a rival team I hate. Sports and sexiness really revs me up. But tell me what you like.","For me, anything that is figure-hugging is very sexy. Being able to see the shape and outline of boobs and the va-jay-jay is really attractive ... and I'm not specifically talking about /r/cameltoe here, but anything that's flush with the body's shape is really sexy.",2,2,1,2,2,2,2

Why isn't incest legal? I honstly dont see anything wrong so long its of legal age and they both love each other. What's so bad about it?,"You WILL get some backlash for this haha.

Do people here actually have Republican friends? I don't.  I barely register them as people.,"Yes but he?s spiritual broken and doesn?t believe in Republicans or conservative ideology anymore.

"A capella that mimics instruments is stupid. A capella, when trying to mimic instruments is just stupid. Why would I listen to someone trying to imitate an instrument with their mouth when I can just listen to the original instrument. A capella, when used to get the musical effect of a human voice alone or only with other human voices is fine, but using your voice to imitate an instrument is just stupid, pointless, and sounds worse than an actual instrument.","Scat is awesome.
