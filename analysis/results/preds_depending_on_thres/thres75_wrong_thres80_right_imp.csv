"Some ways that Israeli's use to dehumanize Palestinians ""They love death more than life"" ""They don't love their children like we do"" I hear this a lot when debating, the brainwashing in Israeli society is quite deep. They really see this as a legitimate reason for occupying/oppressing. Quite nasty. Apparently I was wrong because I said that Israeli's are wrong in generalizing 2 million residents of Gaza. What are some other things they say/do to dehumanize Palestinians?","Call them Goyim and say Jews are the master race, that's a big one.",2,2,1,0,0,0,2
"Does anyone try to hold in a shit in public toilets despite actually being on the toilet. Like I feel like it's pre weird if other people around and hear me shit, but I mean, I'm in a cubicle on the toilet like I'm meant to. Maybe I'm just hella self conscious idk.","If you CANT wait, I suggest flushing as you poop so they can?t hear it. You may just have some water splash up, but if it?s an emergency or not a strong toilet where it won?t splash, it helps a lot.",2,2,1,1,1,1,2
"The Crazies (just got put on Canadian Netflix) gives off a serious Stephen King Vibe, its like a great adaption that King hasn't written yet. I just re-watched The Crazies (Timothy Olyphant) since it was released on Canadian Netflix, and I must say its a pretty good movie. The last 30 minutes are a bit rushed, but the beginning build up in the town was great.  Hints of The Stand and Desperation from Stephen King for sure.  Check it out if you are interested.",The nuke scene is so badass. Like at that point they completely lost control so they resort to dropping a nuke on a tiny Iowan town lol.,2,2,1,1,1,1,2
"it is okay to eat cats and dogs if it is a part of your culture every country or culture has its own culinary specialties, Muslim don't eat porks, Jewish don't eat a lot of things, French love frogs, snails, and foie gras. We use to eat horses or porcupine. Why is it such a crime to eat cats and dogs? this is just a gatekeeping idea from narrow-minded people that don't want to understand other people history and culture.",Jews eat foreskin*,2,2,0,0,0,0,2
My non popular draft opinion What if we sign Foles and drafted DK Metcalf with our first round?  Then draft a QB round 2 to sit behind Foles.  I think Metcalf is going to be a huge threat in the NFL and we need his exact type,"let?s make sure that metcalf pisses clean at the combine first, dude looks like david boston?s son.",2,2,1,1,1,1,2
Did any of your parents not let you play certain types of video games because they were ?Satanic?? I wasn?t allowed to play PokÃ©mon because it was considered violent by my parents until I hit middle school. By then the craze had died down. I had friends that told me the reason they couldn?t play it was because their parents considered it ?Satanic?? I have no doubt that the weird religious articles surrounding PokÃ©mon had a big influence on my parents decision. Did any of you guys experience something similar with your parents?,When the first Shrek came out I wasn?t allowed to watch it because the church we attended at the time claimed that Shrek was slang for doggystyle and that him and Donkey were gay for each other.,2,2,1,0,0,0,2
"hacks I'm hoping this can be a big thread of all the hacks related to uottawa, whether it be shortcuts or hidden places on campus or perks that most people don't know about...whatever comes to mind.","We have tunnels. Some say splinter factions of the Viet Cong are still lurking, waiting to defend the motherland from the filthy capitalist invaders.",2,2,1,1,1,1,2
"How is filipino ""flirting"" culture? Hiya guys!! I've been lurking in this sub for a while, hoping I get to visit Philippines soon. About the question, I want to clarify I don't mean in a ""sex tourism"" way at all, nor am asking for sex workers. I mean if they are open to a fun conversation/laughs while drinking or in other environments (I guess it's not the same flirting with someone in a disco in Boracay than being in a casual bar in Metro Manila.)","If you're Caucasian/Hispanic(not latino) don't even bother with Filipino ""flirting"" culture, these women swoon over foreigners without any standard whatsoever. Edit:Thanks for the clarification",2,2,1,1,1,1,2
"Streamers wanting blacklists, new ToS against camping. This is getting out of hand. Was just watching Quin talking about how Blizzard should create ToS that stops people from ganking other players in Classic. Among other streamers like Sodipoppin and Asmongold just calling for straight out bans for trolling is absurd, I really hope streamers don't ruin Classic WoW for the majority because a minority streamer playerbase are having a hard time adjusting to Classic WoW.","This is bullcrap lol. If you can't handle PvP, there are carebear PvE servers for you.",2,2,1,1,1,1,2
"What's it like being a regular guy? I kinda can't relate, I'm so used to being treated like a girl that even my mannerisms are feminine.",boring. 10/10 would be gay,2,2,1,0,0,0,2
